# videoconferencing_with_zegocloud
this is simple videoconference app using django
Hey i am lakhan and this is my first project on github special thanks to @teja156 for this useful project

Step1: First you need to create virtual environment by this command in your desire folder
python -m venv name
Step2: activate your virtual environment 
.\name\Scripts\activate
in case any error shown use this command in window powershell:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
step3: Install django in your virtual environment
step4: Now run server
python manage.py runserver
You must have ZegoCloud account to connect your app with it(check online how to create zegocloud account and use it for videoconference and check out tech raj channel on youtube)
that's it
